                    <p>Visual Hierarchy is a principle that allows us to arrange elements in order of importance. This allows designers to show the information they want the users to see, control the user's perception of the experience, and guide the user towards desired actions.</p>
                    <p>Some of the characteristics controlled by Visual Hierarchy are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Size</li>
                        <li>Color</li>
                        <li>Contrast</li>
                        <li>Alignment</li>
                        <li>Proximity</li>
                        <li>White space</li>
                        <li>Textures and styles</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>When it comes to Visual UX design, having an interface that impresses and persuade users is essential for it to succeed. In the example of Uber, we can see they use a black and white palette to call attention to specific details like the option to become a Driver, or the options on top to login or sign in. It also shows some of their additional services like Eat and "Taxi".</p>

                    <h1>Udemy</h1>

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Fitts’s law is a predictive model for the speed of human movement, commonly used in human-computer interaction. It states that the time it takes someone to select an object depends on how far they are from the object and the size of the object. Small objects that are far from your starting position or related objects that are far away from each other take the longest time to select. Large objects that are close to your starting position or related objects that are close together take the shortest time to select.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When your cursor is far away from a small call-to-action, you need to be more precise to accuracy click on it, increasing the time and energy you spend moving your mouse toward the CTA. But when your cursor is close to a large CTA, you don’t need to be as precise to accurately click on it. You can spend less time and energy moving your mouse toward the CTA and still get the same result.
                    </p>

                    <p>In this example, in Udemy's website we can see that the biggest call to action is to type what we want to learn. If we scrolling down it does give us some suggestions, but still the option that's more easily accessible is to type what we are interested in.</p>

                    <h1>Contrast</h1>
                    <h1>Apple</h1>
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a>
                </div>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing how Apple.com utilizes Contrast">

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Contrast is the relationship between two or more design elements whose dramatic differences are emphasized when both elements are shown together. The degree of contrast between these elements is disproportionate to their level of similarity: the less similar two items are, the greater the contrast between them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Light blue or any other pastel color, for example, wouldn’t be particularly prominent on an interface with other pastels of similar shades. But, if pastel elements were juxtaposed with darker, bold elements such as a deep eggplant color, the difference between the dark and light colors would be pronounced.
                    </p>
                    <p>One key virtue of contrast in web design lies in its impact on visual hierarchy. As we mentioned, contrast can be created by a variation in sizing, shape, color, or other features. Emphasizing a dichotomy of importance between two design elements doesn’t depend on the type of contrast that exists — rather on the degree of polarity between them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>For example Apple's website uses a dark background with clear font, but a gradient of color in the options they want you to focus on. </p>
